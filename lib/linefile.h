/**
 * this file is used to read text file into struct LineFile.
 * struct LineFile has its limit. 
 * for now, at most, it can process a line with 9 int , 9 double, 9 char, 9 long, 9 string(char *), that means 45 parts in one line.
 * lines will be seprated into parts with "\t", space, ":", "\n", ",".
 *
 * when you want to read a file, just use create_LineFile, with right parameters.
 * when you use a struct LineFile, you should have a purpose.
 * 	for example, use lf(a struct LineFile object) to create a iidNet, then you should use i1,i2,d1.
 * 		then you should check lf->i1, lf->i2, lf->d1 != NULL.
 * 			if any one of these three is NULL, there is something wrong.
 *
 * when you get a file contains only 2 parts in a line, but you use create_LineFile(xx, 1, 1, 1, -1);
 * 	then you get -1 for each i3[x];
 *
 * when you get a file contains 3 int parts in a line, but you use create_LineFile(xx, 1, 1, -1);
 * 	then you only fetch the first 2 parts from each line. lf->i3 will be NULL.
